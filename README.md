## Overview

This application allows users to subscribe to weather updates and receive them via email at their preferred interval. It's built with modern TypeScript technologies:

- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) - Fast, lightweight web framework
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - TypeScript ORM for SQL databases
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Robust relational database
- [Resend](https://resend.com/) - Email delivery service
- [Croner](https://github.com/hexagon/croner) - Cron-based job scheduler

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you'll need:

- Node.js (v22.13.0 or higher)
- npm (v10.9.2 or higher)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A domain for email sending

## Setup Weather API

1. Go to [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
2. Register an account
3. Create an API key
4. You'll add this key to your `.env` file in the installation steps

## Setup Email Sending

1. Purchase a domain on [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns) or another provider
2. Go to [Resend](https://resend.com/)
3. Register an account
4. Follow the instructions to set up your domain for email sending
5. Create an API key
6. You'll add this key to your `.env` file in the installation steps

## Installation & Local Development

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file from the template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Fill the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration

5. Start the required services with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d pg
   ```

6. Run the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Access the application:
   - Subscribe form: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Swagger API documentation: [http://localhost:3000/swagger](http://localhost:3000/swagger)

## Running in Docker

For a full production-like environment:

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a `.env` file from the template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Fill the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration

4. Start the application and all services using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Subscribe form: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Swagger API documentation: [http://localhost:3000/swagger](http://localhost:3000/swagger)

## Database Management

Database migrations are automatically run when the application starts.

To generate a new migration after making schema changes:

```bash
npm run migrations:generate
```

## Development Scripts

```bash
# Run the application in development mode
npm run dev

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production build
npm run start

# Run tests
npm run test

# Format code
npm run format:fix

# Lint code
npm run lint:fix
```

## Project Architecture

### API Structure

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) - Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Services** (`src/services/`) - Implement business logic
- **Repositories** (`src/repositories/`) - Handle data access
- **Templates** (`src/templates/`) - Define email templates

### Design Decisions

#### Weather API Integration

This project uses [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch accurate weather data. The service layer abstracts the API integration, making it easy to swap providers if needed.

#### Email Delivery

The application uses [Resend](https://resend.com/) for reliable email delivery. Emails are generated using custom templates and delivered at the user's preferred intervals.

#### JWT for Subscription Management

This application uses JWT tokens rather than storing inactive subscriptions in the database for several reasons:

1. **Reduced Database Overhead**: Prevents storing temporary data in the database
2. **Improved Developer Experience**: Simplifies subscription management
3. **Stateless Verification**: Subscriptions can be verified without database queries

The JWT contains all necessary information for subscription creation, and if a user wants to resubscribe after the verification period (10 minutes), a new token is simply generated.

For more robust production environments, a Redis-based token store with TTL could be implemented, but this would add unnecessary complexity for this project.

#### Scheduling

The application uses [Croner](https://github.com/hexagon/croner) for scheduling weather updates instead of a message queue system because:

1. **Simplified Timing**: Weather updates are sent at fixed intervals (hourly/daily) or not at all
2. **User Expectations**: Attempting to retry failed email deliveries could create confusing timing for users
3. **Reduced Complexity**: In-memory scheduling is simpler to implement and maintain

For applications requiring more robust retry mechanisms and scalability, a message queue system like BullMQ would be more appropriate, but this would introduce unnecessary complexity for this project's requirements.
